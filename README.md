# Wheat-disease-app
A machine learning based mobile application to detect wheat crop diseases(Brown rust, Healthy, Loose smut, Septoria, Yellow rust)using image classification. Built with Python, Flask, and integrated into a Flutter-based mobile application.

Tech Stack of the project 
- Frontend : Flutter (Dart)
- Backend : Python, Flask
- ML Model: CNN using TensorFlow
- Styling : HTML,CSS,JS
  
Dataset Not Included:
The dataset used to train and test the model is too large to be hosted on GitHub. Please download or place it manually.

 Model Files Not Included:
Trained model files (e.g., .h5) are excluded due to GitHubâ€™s file size limits. You may train your own or request access separately.

 Some folders were not uploaded (e.g., build artifacts, cache, virtual environments) to keep the repository clean.
